## Description

Rainy Days is a cross-course project developed over my first year at Noroff. It’s an online shop for a conceptual brand specializing in outdoor jackets. The project’s journey started in our Design course were I designed and prototyped the website in Figma. As our coding skills progressed with new courses, I brought the design to life with HTML and CSS. With the introduction of JavaScript, I later enhanced the sites functionality. The site have further been refined based on insights gained from user testing and Hotjar analytics.

An online shop selling men's and women’s rain jackets. They are designed for a range of different outdoor activities that enrich people's lives. Target audience: men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interest are beeing outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing.
