# CA - HTML & CSS - Rainy Days

This is a repository for the Course Assignment in the HTML & CSS course at Noroff (first semester). 
The task is to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief we chose to do in the course "Design 1", where we learned to design and prototype in Figma. 

The brief I chose where "Rainy Days", which is an online shop selling men's and women's jackets designed for a range of different outdoor activities. 

The site, originally built with just HTML and CSS, can be viewed live at: https://rainydays-kew.netlify.app/

There were two distinct aspects to this assignment: Setup and configure a headless WordPress + WooCommerce API, and fetch this API as a data source and display it as part of your cross-course project.

The assignement is done in the CMS branch of the cross-course-project and not pulled to main at this time.
