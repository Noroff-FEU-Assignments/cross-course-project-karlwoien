# CA - HTML & CSS - Rainy Days

This is a repository for the Course Assignment in the HTML & CSS course at Noroff (first semester). The task is to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief we chose to do in the course "Design 1", where we learned to design and prototype in Figma. The brief I chose where "Rainy Days", which is an online shop selling men's and women's jackets designed for a range of different outdoor activities. 

The site, built with HTML and CSS, can be viewed live at: https://rainydays-kew.netlify.app/
