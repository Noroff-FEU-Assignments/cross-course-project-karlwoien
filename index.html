    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> I would advise the client to implement sanitiazion of data. As stated in this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security" >MDN article</a> 
    «The single most important lesson you can learn about website security is to never trust data from the browser». Data sanitization implies secure and permanent removal of data from a dataset or media so that it can’t be restored. The easiest way would be to use a well-known third-party solution for this.</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Furthermore, I would advise the client to implementing HTTPS so that the communication between servers and the client is encrypted. This will help send data securely and can help protect your data from attacks.</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would also advise the client to implement a secure authorization and authentication such as Google- or Microsoft Authenticator in case of login options.</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Finally, I would suggest including everyone in the security practices. This including both employees in the client’s business and the team possibly developing the website or solutions. It’s important that everyone involved know and understand the security risks on the web.</p>
